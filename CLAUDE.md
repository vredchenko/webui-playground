# Claude Context - WebUI Playground

## Project Purpose
Frontend playground/zoo of diverse, unrelated frontend collectables. Not a homogeneous UI library - items are independent showcases of various frontend techniques and demonstrations.

## Key Decisions
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Component Framework:** Predominantly React/TS, sometimes vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- **Documentation:** Storybook
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via CI/CD
- **Organization:** Categorical (typography, colors, icons, widgets, animations, etc.)
- **Styling:** Flexible per-item - no enforced approach. Each item can use whatever styling method is most appropriate.

## Content Categories
- Fonts & typography demonstrations
- Color palettes
- Backgrounds
- SVG icons
- UI widgets & controls
- Styling effects
- Animations

## Future Scope
- Design tokens system (centralized colors, spacing, typography)
- npm package publishing
- Accessibility testing (Storybook a11y addon)
- Dark/light theme support
- Visual regression testing (Chromatic)

## Important Context for Claude
- This is NOT a homogeneous UI library
- Items are independent and unrelated
- Categorical organization reflects the diverse "zoo" nature of content
- Flexibility in styling approaches is intentional and important
